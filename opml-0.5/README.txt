**opml** provides simple support for reading `OPML <http://opml.org>`_
files.  OPML is an XML-based format for describing outlines and is
often used as an interchange format for subscription lists.  This
package is intended as a light-weight, permissive parser.  It does
very little validation of the incoming OPML.
